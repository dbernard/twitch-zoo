## Configuration

Edit the `config.ini` file with your Twitch API client ID
([generated here](https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections)) and collection
of users to monitor. The users collection can be either plain Twitch user names,
or a pipe-delimited collection of Twitch usernames and Extra Life participant ID
numbers (i.e. `user|participantId`).  If an Extra Life ID is associated with a
username, a donation link will appear alongside the stream.

Example:
```
[APP]
CLIENT_ID=[TWITCH_CLIENT_ID]
USERS=USER1|214742,USER2,USER3|214742
```
